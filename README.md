# Lumea Systems code repository

This repository contains the data as well as the analysis code and plotting for the Lutea systems project as part of the Cassini Hackathon. 

Our goal is to avoid potential ecosystem destructions, prevent casualities and protect investments. To achieve our goals we are using European space data by analyzing both images and signals provided by the the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission (ESA) and the Federal Office of Topography (Swisstopo).

## What is in this repository? 

Here you find different satallite and weather analysis codes as well as a fluid simulation package. The `moisture_analysis` and `water_index_analysis` notebooks use simple Machine Learning algorithms to identify the possible risk areas in Sion and in the Canton of Valais. This is achieved by processing 2D images from the Snetinel-2 mission. The `weather_analysis` code uses data from SwissMeteo for the past 60 years to process weather parameters in Sion. These include: daily mean temperature, max and min temperatures at 2 meters above ground, precipitation level, pressure at station level, tototal snow depth, etc. Interesting correlations between variables are also shown in the notebook. The weather data is a very powerful tool to help us in the assessment of the risk areas.
